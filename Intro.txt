1) create aa reatcjs app and link it to a github repo 

2) now deploy it on github by using following steps  ..     ( mANUAL DEPLOY THAT WE DO CASUALLY ) 

    >> npm i gh-pages --save-dev
    >> now go to the package.json and update the "homepage" as : "https://githubusername.github.io/myreactapp

    after that add these two in thr script tag there  ...

            "scripts": {
                "predeploy" : "npm run build",
                "deploy" : "gh-pages -d build",
            }

    >> now git add , commit and push 
    >> after that >>  git run deploy

    >> after that our react app will be up and running  >> https://githubusername.github.io/myreactapp/
